.AT 3
.SH NAME
flip \- do newline conversions between **IX and MS\-DOS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B flip \-h
.sp  0
.B flip 
\-umvtsbz
.B file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Flip
is a file interchange program that converts text file formats
between **IX and MS\-DOS.  It converts lines ending with carriage\-return
(CR) and linefeed (LF) to lines ending with just linefeed, or vice versa.
.PP
.I Flip
has the following features.
.TP
o
If a file contains isolated CR characters for underlining or
overprinting,
.I flip
does not change them.
.TP
o
When asked to convert a file to the same format that it
already has,
.I flip
causes no change to the file.  Thus to
convert all files to **IX format you can type
.IP "" 10
.I flip
.B \-u
*.*  (under MS\-DOS)
.sp 0
.I flip
.B \-u
*    (under **IX)
.IP "" 5
and all files will end up right, regardless of whether they
were in MS-DOS or in **IX format to begin with.  This also
works in the opposite direction.
.TP
o
.I Flip
preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.
.TP
o
.I Flip
is written in C and will compile and run under
MS-DOS/Turbo C, 4.3BSD, and System V.
.TP
o
.I Flip
accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the
command line.
.TP
o
If a user interrupt aborts
.IR Flip ,
it does not leave behind
any garbage files or cause corruption of the files being
converted.
.TP
o
.I Flip
will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You can
override this.
.TP
o
When converting from MS-DOS to **IX format,
.I flip
removes any
trailing control Z (the last character in the file), but
leaves embedded control Z characters unchanged.  This minimizes
the possibility of accidentally converting a binary file that
contains a control Z near the beginning.  You can override this
and ask
.I flip
to recognize the first control Z found as end-of-file.
.TP
o
.I Flip
can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it converts
a file.
.PP
.I Flip
is normally invoked as:
.IP "" 5
.I flip
.B \-umhvtb
file ...
.IP "" 0
One of
.BR \-u ,
.BR \-m ,
or
.B \-h
is required.  Switches may be given separately or
combined together after a dash.  For example, the three command lines given
below are equivalent:
.IP "" 5
.I flip
.B \-uvt
*.c
.sp 0
.I flip
.B "-u -v -t"
*.c
.sp 0
.I flip
.B "-u -vt"
*.c
.PP
The meanings of the switches are as follows.
.TP
\-u
convert to **IX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF unchanged,
trailing control Z removed, embedded control Z unchanged)
.TP
\-m
convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR unchanged)
.TP
\-h
give a help message
.TP
\-v
be verbose, print filenames as they are processed
.TP
\-t
touch files (don't preserve timestamps)
.TP
\-s
strip high bit
.TP
\-b
convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged)
.TP
\-z
truncate file at first control Z encountered
.PP
On systems that allow a program to know its own name,
.I flip
may be renamed (or
linked) to a file called
.I toix
(or
.I toix.exe
under MS-DOS) for conversion
to **IX format, or to a file called
.I toms
(or
.I toms.exe
under MS-DOS) for
conversion to MS-DOS format.  When invoked with the name
.I toix
or
.IR toms,
.I flip
will act as if it were invoked with the
.B \-u
or
.B \-m
option respectively.
