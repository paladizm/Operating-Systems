       _F_l_i_p  is  a  file  interchange  program that converts text file formats
       between **IX and MS-DOS.  It converts lines ending with carriage-return
       (CR)  and  linefeed  (LF)  to  lines ending with just linefeed, or vice
       versa.

       _F_l_i_p has the following features.

       o      If a file contains isolated CR  characters  for  underlining  or
              overprinting, _f_l_i_p does not change them.

       o      When  asked to convert a file to the same format that it already
              has, _f_l_i_p causes no change to the file.   Thus  to  convert  all
              files to **IX format you can type

                 _f_l_i_p --uu *.*  (under MS-DOS)
                 _f_l_i_p --uu *    (under **IX)

            and  all  files will end up right, regardless of whether they were
            in MS-DOS or in **IX format to begin with.  This also works in the
            opposite direction.

       o    _F_l_i_p preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.

       o    _F_l_i_p  is  written in C and will compile and run under MS-DOS/Turbo
            C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

       o    _F_l_i_p accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the command line.

       o    If  a  user  interrupt  aborts  _F_l_i_p, it does not leave behind any
            garbage files or cause corruption of the files being converted.

       o    _F_l_i_p will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You can  over-
            ride this.

       o    When  converting  from  MS-DOS  to  **IX  format, _f_l_i_p removes any
            trailing control Z (the last character in the  file),  but  leaves
            embedded  control Z characters unchanged.  This minimizes the pos-
            sibility of accidentally converting a binary file that contains  a
            control  Z near the beginning.  You can override this and ask _f_l_i_p
            to recognize the first control Z found as end-of-file.

       o    _F_l_i_p can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it converts  a
            file.

       _F_l_i_p is normally invoked as:

            _f_l_i_p --uummhhvvttbb file ...


       One  of --uu, --mm, or --hh is required.  Switches may be given separately or
       combined together after a dash.  For example, the three  command  lines
       given below are equivalent:

            _f_l_i_p --uuvvtt *.c
            _f_l_i_p --uu --vv --tt *.c
            _f_l_i_p --uu --vvtt *.c

       The meanings of the switches are as follows.

       -u     convert  to  **IX  format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF unchanged,
              trailing control Z removed, embedded control Z unchanged)

       -m     convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR unchanged)

       -h     give a help message

       -v     be verbose, print filenames as they are processed

       -t     touch files (donâ€™t preserve timestamps)

       -s     strip high bit

       -b     convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged)

       -z     truncate file at first control Z encountered

       On systems that allow a program to know  its  own  name,  _f_l_i_p  may  be
       renamed  (or  linked)  to a file called _t_o_i_x (or _t_o_i_x_._e_x_e under MS-DOS)
       for conversion to **IX format, or to a file called  _t_o_m_s  (or  _t_o_m_s_._e_x_e
       under  MS-DOS)  for conversion to MS-DOS format.  When invoked with the
       name _t_o_i_x or _t_o_m_s_, _f_l_i_p will act as if it were invoked with the  --uu  or
       --mm option respectively.
